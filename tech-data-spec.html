                                                <p>e. Use Code 14 for any AUS result not listed in Codes 1 through 13. For a transaction in which your institution enters Code 14, enter the result generated by the AUS developed by a securitzer, Federal government insurer, or guarantor that was used to evaluate the application.</p>
                                                <p>f. Use Code 15 for "not applicable" if your institution did not consider a result generated by an AUS developed by a securitzer, Federal government insurer, or guarantor in its underwriting process. For example, use Code 15 if your institution only manually underwrote the application. Also, use Code 10 if the file was closed for incompleteness or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made.</p>
                                                <p>g. Use Code 16 if the loan is a purchased loan.</p>
